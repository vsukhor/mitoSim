### Scripts


The python scripts here are intended for:

- analysis of some simulation results generated by the main application and reported in the logfile (read_log.py)

- numerical solution and analysis of differential-algebraic system approximating the mitochondria graph (odes.py)


These are also accompanied by the corresponding ipython notebooks (tested under jupyter-notebook v. 6.0.3).
